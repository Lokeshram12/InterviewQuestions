Browser's JavaScript Execution:

Async tasks are offloaded to the browser's event loop, and the main thread remains responsive.
Threads include UI thread, network thread, and JavaScript engine thread.
Examples of event loop in action, rendering updates, handling user interactions, and executing JavaScript code asynchronously.

Tools like Chrome DevTools provide advanced debugging capabilities, including real-time code execution, breakpoints, and performance analysis.
